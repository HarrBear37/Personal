            <h1>Hello There!</h1>
            <hr></hr>
            <p>I'm making a story about animals. I don't know when I'm finish it. Probably not for another few years. But I want to keep a blog or a place to keep you updated. I really like to make stories. I might try to add other stories I make like short stories and other long stories I make!</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <hr></hr>
            <p>My name is Harry Bartolotti. I am 19 years old. I am currently studying at Penn State Behrend (Erie). My major is Digital Media. Even though it is my major, I hope to become a writer one day. I don't have to make a lot of money from it. As long as I am about to share my stories them I will be happy!</p>
            <p>I was born on November 27th, 2004. My birthplace was in Guatemala. I don't speak Spanish thought. I was adopted shortly after my birth. I have tried to learn Spanish to get back to my roots. I like the country I was born in. It has a very interesting culture. I like colorful houses.</p>
